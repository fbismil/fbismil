- Hi!!! 
- I'm ditching my field to purse software engineering! 
- After weeks of not knowing where to start and getting confused with tech lingo, 
  I have begun to venture into The Odin Project, CS50x, and discrete math before attempting a second bachelor's in comp sci! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!!
  
-is this what having a passion feels like???
